## honetsly i have no idea how we are expected to be able to do this after a few weeks experience. i did the best i could. i spent 20+ hours and this is the best it's gonna get. the scores and initials save in the console and local storage. thats as good as i could get it. multiple people explained to me that i could use a for loop to display them on the page. i now how to use for loops in many cases, but i have no idea how to do it and i have no ideo how any of the documentation sent to me relates to any of this. Honestly if you think i don't have what it takes for this, please let me know. I'm so lost, and i just feel completely ridilulous
